# Welcome to Scientific Computing in Matlab

Matlab is one of the main tools for the analysis of scientific data. This course will introduce the student to scientific computing, data analysis, and statistics in Matlab. Students learn general programming techniques, based on specific examples from the field of Neuroscience; including the analysis of behavioral data, functional imaging, and spike and local field recordings.

The course content is organized by Modules; new ones will become available as we progress through the course. If you're stuck, post a question on the General Channel on Microsoft Teams.

## Before the First Week - Matlab Basics

This course is aimed at students with some experience working with Matlab. To assess your skill level, or to brush up your skills, you should go through the Matlab Basics module. To help you decide whether you need to review  a specific section, here are the main topics, per section:

**The Matlab Environment**
:
 - Customize the Matlab Desktop to your needs
-  Find documentation on any Matlab related topic
- Use Matlab as a fancy calculator
- Use Matlab to graph some data

**Elementary Matlab**
:
- Extract values from any matrix 
- Find and change values in a matrix
- Reshape matrices
- Perform elementary mathematical operations on your numerical data

**Program Flow - I**
:
- Write well-formed functions, including help text, and documentation
- Decide when to use for- or while- loops
- Use conditional execution to solve complex program flow. 
- Handle errors as they occur during script execution.

**Program Flow - II**
:
- Manipulate arrays to find and extract data.
- Write functions and scripts
- Use or avoid loops 

Each Section has assignments. When working on these, make sure to study the documentation (using the help or doc command) for each of the commands that you need (or that are suggested in the assignments). The help instructions often have "Related functions" at the bottom of the text; some of those could be relevant too, so browse around to improve your knowledge of Matlab commands.


## The First Week - Getting Organized

The main goal this week is to get familiar with the online format and the various tools we use in this course.

**Note that due to the flipped format of the class, you will be working on the assignments of this module in the week before the first class.
In the first class, you then have the opportunity to ask questions or raise issues that surface during the preceding week**.

## To Do List
1. Read the Syllabus and the Schedule
2. Review Matlab Basics 
3. Introduce yourself on the [Discussion Forum](https://github.com/orgs/Scientific-Computing-in-Matlab/teams/students-2023)
