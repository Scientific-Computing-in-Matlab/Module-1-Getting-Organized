# Welcome to Scientific Computing in Matlab

Matlab is one of the main tools for the analysis of scientific data. This course will introduce the student to scientific computing, data analysis, and statistics in Matlab. Students learn general programming techniques, based on specific examples from the field of Neuroscience; including the analysis of behavioral data, functional imaging, and spike and local field recordings.

The course content is organized by Modules; new ones will become available via GitHub and GitHub Classroom as we progress through the course. 
If you're stuck, check the [Discussion Forum](https://github.com/orgs/Scientific-Computing-in-Matlab/teams/students-2023) or post a new question there. 

## The First Week - Getting Organized

The main goal this week is to get familiar with the online format and the various tools we use in this course.

**Note that due to the flipped format of the class, you will be working on the assignments of this module in the week before the first class.
In the first class, you then have the opportunity to ask questions or raise issues that surface during the preceding week**.

### Folders and Files

Good programming practices - resulting in fewer bugs, more reusable and more reliable code -  start before you even write a single line of code.  
[This video]() explains how to set up structured folders for data analysis projects.

### Git and GitHub

Git is a version control system for very large software development projects. Mmany of its features are a bit overkill for our current modest goals. Luckily, you need to know only a small subset of commands to use Git/GitHub successfully for smaller projects.

Here is a brief introduction of the main advantages, and the most important terminology. 

GitHub Guides are very helpful to understand the basics of using Git and GitHub. 

If you're not yet familiar with git and GitHub, please work through the

Hello World tutorial on GitHub, 

In this course, we use GitHub to allow the instructors to review and comment on student assignments. 

Now it is time to 

Install git on your computer
Install one of the free GUI packages for git. In the videos I use GitDesktop, but there are several options:  GitKraken for any OS, GitExtensions for Windows, or GitDesktop for Windows and macOS. 
Create an account on GitHub
Then join our GitHub Classroom by accepting the first assignment: This assignment will give you more Git and GitHub background and will help to understand the next sentence:
Follow this link to create the main assignment repository. This repo contains the starter code for assignments in this course. Clone it to your machine to work on assignments in the /code folder and review course materials in the docs/. By committing and pushing code from this repo to GitHub you submit assignments and provide the teachers with a convenient way to give line-by-line feedback.
