# Welcome to Scientific Computing in Matlab

Matlab is one of the main tools for the analysis of scientific data. This course will introduce the student to scientific computing, data analysis, and statistics in Matlab. Students learn general programming techniques, based on specific examples from the field of Neuroscience; including the analysis of behavioral data, functional imaging, and electrophysiological recordings.

The course content is organized by Modules; new Modules will become available as links to a new assignment in GitHub Classroom. Each Module is a separate git repository that contains a Readme.md file (like this one) with instructions as well as supporting docs, data, and starter code for assignments. You can read the Readme file in a browser and follow links to materials and videos there. But you should clone the repository to your machine to work on the assignments. If you are new to Git and GitHub, the assignment below will help you get familiar.

If you're stuck, check the [Discussion Forum](https://github.com/orgs/Scientific-Computing-in-Matlab/teams/students-2023) or post a new question there.

## The First Week - Getting Organized

The main goal this week is to get familiar with the online format and the various tools we use in this course.

**Note that due to the flipped format of the class, you will be working on the assignments of this module in the week before the first class.
In the first class, you then have the opportunity to ask questions or raise issues that surface during the preceding week**.

### Git and GitHub

Git is a version control system for very large software development projects. Many of its features are a bit overkill for our current modest goals. Luckily, you need to know only a small subset of commands to use Git/GitHub successfully for smaller projects.

Learn about Git and GitHub by completing [this assignment](https://classroom.github.com/a/tOy8ASUu).
### Folders and Files

Good programming practices - resulting in fewer bugs, more reusable and more reliable code -  start before you even write a single line of code.  
[This video](https://youtu.be/MGYSZHscos8) explains how to set up structured folders for data analysis projects.
