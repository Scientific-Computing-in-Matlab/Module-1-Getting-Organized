# Scientific Computing in Matlab

Invitation Email:

The first meeting of the Matlab course ('Scientific Computing in Matlab': 26:112:611) will start at 9 am EST on January 18th, 2023. Attached are the syllabus and the schedule.

Coding is not something you can learn from listening to a lecture. Therefore, this is very much a hands-on class; you will be viewing online videos, reading tutorial scripts, and working on  assignments for most of this course. Course materials and assignments for the course will all be distributed via GitHub. The class hours (Wed: 9-11 am) are primarily intended for you to ask questions. So please write down your questions as you are preparing for the class, and post them in the GitHub forum (details to follow).

Depending on your current level of experience with programming, Matlab, and Git, there are various things that you need to do before the first class.

What you should do **now**:

- If you don't have one already, create a (free) account on GitHub.com
- Send your GitHub username and the email address you used to sign up to me (bart@rutgers.edu). I will then add you to our GitHub Organization and to the Matlab Grader website. Only then will you have access to the GitHub Classroom links below.

What you should do **over the next 3 weeks**:

    1. [GitHub Starter](https://classroom.github.com/a/tOy8ASUu):
This will give an overview of Git and GitHub, essential tools for software development, which we will use throughout this course. Once you're familiar with Git and GitHub, you should install one of the free packages for git on your computer. There are several options:Â  GitKraken for any OS, GitExtensions for Windows, or GitDesktop for Windows and macOS.
    2. [Module 0 - Matlab Basics](https://classroom.github.com/a/fSPQOOPw)
This course is aimed at students with some experience with Matlab. To assess your skill level, or to brush up your skills, you should go through the Matlab Basics module **before the course starts**.
    3. [Module 1 - Getting Organized](https://classroom.github.com/a/6Ztdv9j_)
This is the module with material for the first class. As this course uses the flipped class format, you should work on this material **before the first class**.

Kirsten and I are looking forward to working with you this semester to improve your data analysis skills.
