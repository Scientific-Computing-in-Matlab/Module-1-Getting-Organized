# Scientific Computing in Matlab

Invitation Email:

The official first meeting of the Matlab course ('Scientific Computing in Matlab': 26:112:611) will be on January 18th, 2023.

Attached are the syllabus and the schedule.

As this is a **flipped class**, there is work to do before that day!

This year, course materials and assignments for the course will all be distributed via  GitHub Classroom.

What you should do **now**:

- Create a (free) account on GitHub.com
- Send your GitHub username and the email address you used to sign up to bart@rutgers.edu. I will then add you to our GitHub Classroom and Organization.
- Once you've been added to the class you should work through the following assignments:
    1. [GitHub Starter](https://classroom.github.com/a/tOy8ASUu):
This will give an overview of Git and GitHub, essential tools for software development, which we will use throughout this course. Once you're familiar with Git and GitHub, you should install one of the free packages for git on your computer. There are several options:Â  GitKraken for any OS, GitExtensions for Windows, or GitDesktop for Windows and macOS.
    2. [Module 0 - Matlab Basics](https://classroom.github.com/a/fSPQOOPw)
This course is aimed at students with some experience with Matlab. To assess your skill level, or to brush up your skills, you should go through the Matlab Basics module **before the course starts**.
    3. [Module 1 - Getting Organized](https://classroom.github.com/a/6Ztdv9j_)
This is the module with material for the first class. As this course uses the flipped class format, you should work on this material **before the first class**.
